# Sudoku Solver

This project implements a Sudoku solver with a graphical user interface using Python and Tkinter.

## Features

- Solve 9x9 Sudoku puzzles
- User-friendly GUI for inputting puzzles and displaying solutions
- Clear functionality to reset the grid

## Installation

1. Clone this repository:
git clone https://github.com/FaridBouakline/sudoku-solver.git
cd sudoku-solver

2. Install the required dependencies:
pip install -r requirement.txt


## Usage

Run the script:
1. Input the initial numbers or click on initialise of the Sudoku puzzle in the GUI.
2. Click "Solve" to find the solution.
